# Guess-My-Number Game JavaScript
 Guess My Number -> A little game to give you an idea of how different algorithms for the same problem can have wildly different efficiencies. The computer is going to randomly select an integer from 1 to 15. You'll keep guessing numbers until you find the computer's number, and the computer will tell you each time if your guess was too high or too low.
